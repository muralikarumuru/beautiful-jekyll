I'm a data platform engineer with focus on building data solutions using azure data platform services.

I love staying current in technology, knowing something new is always exciting. Solving problems with cutting edge technology is even more exciting. I have worked with SQL Server, Microsoft Business Intelligence stack of technologies and I have been strongly focusing on azure data platform services for the last few years.

I watch movies or read books in _my_ free time. I do occasionally share my personal views via my personal blog.
