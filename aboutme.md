I'm a data architect with strong focus on modern data engineering solutions using azure data platform services to translate data into valuable insights. I design and build different types of data models to fulfil data needs of the various business areas.

I occasionally blog here about the technologies I'm working on and learning experience. I enjoy reading books in my free time.

I live with my family in Hyderabad, India but we are currently in United Kingdom for a work assignment.
