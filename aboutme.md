I'm a data platform engineer with strong focus on modern data engineering solutions using azure data platform services. In the past, I have worked on SQL Server and Microsoft Business Intelligence technologies for a long time in an on-premise environment.

I occasionally blog here about the technologies I am working or interested. I enjoy reading books in my free time.

I live with my family in Hyderabad, India but we are currently in United Kingdom for a work assignment.
