I'm an experienced, hands-on data architect and data engineering lead with strong focus on modern data engineering solutions using azure data platform services to translate data into valuable insights. I design and build data models to fulfil data needs of the various business areas. I have helped clients to deliver business intelligence solutions in supply chain domain and cloud data analytics solutions in airlines sector.

I occasionally blog about the technologies I'm working on and learning experience. Away from the computer, I enjoy reading books and likes to be in the fresh air.
