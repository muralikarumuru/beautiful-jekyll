I'm a data platform engineer with strong focus on modern data engineering solutions using azure data platform services. In the past, I have worked on SQL Server and Microsoft Business Intelligence technologies for a long time in an on-premise environment.

I got an opportunity to work in the Azure cloud in 2017. I began transforming data into intelligence on the cloud. I am loving the experienceÂ of building modern data solutions on the cloud.

I kept moving around places along my family depending on my work assignments. When I am not working, I stay at home and spend time with my family and read books.
